**NotSpriteCollab**

NotSpriteCollab is an instance of SpriteBot, maintained by <@!311408582128173056>. It is not to be confused with the primary instance of SpriteBot, SpriteCollab, which can be found in the SkyTemple's Discord server, as well as PMDO's one.

You can upload sprites and portraits that does not fit into SpriteCollab here. Most notably, non-official pokémon and non-pokémon are accepted, with little regard to quality. You are still prohibited of publishing sexually explicit image here.

There still are a moderation phase, but I should not reject sprites/portraits except for blatant issue (I'm not a critique).

**Author's right**

Unlike in SpriteCollab, there are no special right to grant when uploading a sprite here, except the basic right to copy it to make it avalaible inside NotSpriteCollab (that is, it'll be avalaible to user with ``!portrait`` or ``!sprite``, or via GitHub, on which a copy of sprites and portraits are hosted and publicly accessible).

You are still encouraged to put your work under a license that allow reuse. You can make your own license, or use an existing license, like a creative commons license (https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/). To allow any use as long as you are credited, use the CC-BY license.


If the author added a license for their work, it'll be displayed on https://hacknews.pmdcollab.org/page:notspritecollab_credit . If you are an author, indicate the license in #notspritecollab-discussion before submitting your work, and I'll update the page.

Remember to check the license/ask the author before submitting a derivative !

Be aware that I'll by default upload some finished sprites and portraits that weren't added by the author in NotSpriteCollab. If you want them remove, contact marius.

*Also, I'll use also use this repository to put the weekly change in the newsletter*

**Quick "how to add a portrait/sprite guide"**

*I won't speak about the specific of making the sprites or portraits, just how to upload them. Emmuffin made a guide on how to make sprites, and making portrait is very simple*

1. check if the pokémon already exist. You can take a look at the list in #nospritecollab-info
2. If it doesn't exist, use the command ``!add <pokemon name>``. The pokemon name shouldn't have space in the name. For example, you could use ``!add Feraligtr_pirate``
3. You can then use ``!portrait <pokemon name>`` or ``!sprite <pokemon name>``. You can change the template or existing sprite/portraits, or just rename your existing sprite/portraits to the name of the template file.
4. If you are the original 
4. Upload the file in the #notspritecollab-submit channel. If you aren't
